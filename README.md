This is my ICT 103: FUNDAMENTALS OF PROGRAMMING 1ST Activity during my 1st Year of studying BS in Computer Science in Iloilo Science and Technology University S.Y 2022-2023.

I decided to make a program that stores user data input, which include their name, age, occupation, and monthly salary, but what is special about this program is not only it stores user data, but also compute its user's monthly salary by showing the income tax, government tax, other tax, and total income left.

I cannot provide the pseudocode, algorithms, an flowchart since I made it in hardcopy.
